Description: A comprehensive toolkit for sustainable development measurement built around 
    the temporal entropy weighting method. The core 'modified_entropy()' function identifies 
    which indicators "matter most" by measuring how their information diversity evolves over 
    time - indicators with higher entropy weights carry more discriminating power for 
    differentiating between countries/units. The package also provides functions for 
    composite index construction (CESP, JTS, MPI), Phillips-Sul convergence analysis, 
    segmented regression, machine learning variable importance, NMDS ordination, 
    Eurostat spatial data processing, and publication-quality visualization. 
    Developed during research at the Social Progress Imperative (2021-2025).
